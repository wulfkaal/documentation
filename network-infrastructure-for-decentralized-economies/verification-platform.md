# Verification Platform



Through its DAO infrastructure, the Semada platform enables expertise tags, e.g. individual DAOs on the Semada platform. Such DAOs can be used to verify otherwise uncertain or questionable information in both centralized and decentralized businesses. Verification DAOs help create direct and conscious as well as indirect and unconscious trust in the internet.    


Examples of the DAOs that could benefit from the unified frontend UI that functions as Semada’s verification engine include but are not limited to the following:

* Oracle DAO for decentralized business and blockchain connectivity and interoperability
* Wikipedia DAO. For example, compare Wikipedia today with Wikipedia on Semada. The Semada Wikipedia DAO would allow all DAO members to vote on each person's contributions. This would create a self-policed ranking of valuable contributions.
* Fake News DAO
* Decentralized credit score DAO
* Crypto Issuer Verification DAO \(Decentralized Market Driven Disclosure and Verification Forum for trading ventures\)
* Underwriting DAO
* Rideshare DAO
* Meetup DAO
* Publication Board DAO
