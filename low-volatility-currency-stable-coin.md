# Native Low Volatility Currency

Semada's Native Low Volatility Currency \(NLVC\): 

The evolving decentralized commerce necessitates stable cryptocurrencies. Yet, the emerging cryptocurrency market is afflicted with significant volatility. Unlike its centralized counterparts, the cryptocurrency market is not subject to centralized policy making via fiscal and monetary policy tools that ensure the management and stability of purchasing power of cryptocurrencies. Decentralized commerce, in turn, is less likely to evolve if the average consumer cannot rely on the enduring purchasing power and stability of cryptocurrencies over time.  

The Semada native cryptocurrency \(SEM\) and the Semada Stability Mechanism \(SSM\) provide core policy tools that help adjusts the supply of SEM in response to  SEM price movements. Similar to earlier attempts in the Basis model, the mechanism enabling price and purchase power stability in SSM involves 3 tokens: 1. SEM, 2. BONDS, and 3. SHARES. SSM uses the Semada core voting algorithm for decentralized autonomous organizations \(Stability DAO or SDAO\) to improve the Basis model in several core policy functions in a fully decentralized and autonomous way. We illustrate the mathematical limits of crash and burn scenarios of earlier attempts and contrast them with our own stability mechanism and its theoretical limits.
