# WDAG Parameters

Weighting the values of posts according to their initial value and the sum of all references allows a DAO to review past actions. At the same time, typical choices of parameters will ensure stability since it will take concerted group effort to remove the value represented by tokens created during past contributions.

To repeat, the goal is to make it easy to participate for the maximal number and types of users throughout the greatest variation of expertises. Users should not need to be technological authorities to navigate the system and add value. In the vast majority of cases, for the vast majority of users, the user interface \(UI\) will hide all of the details discussed in this section. A simple UI will recommend posts, and allow users to quickly evaluate post after post, staking varied amounts of their limited sem in varied degrees of tightly- and loosely-coupled votes. How the system actually counts the votes and determines the reward structure for references is analyzed in this section.
