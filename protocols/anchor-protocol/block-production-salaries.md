Figure 6: Figure 6 illustrates that after the block producer was awarded her SEM tokens for successful and validated block production, as illustrated in Figure 5, all Anchor token holders in the Anchor Protocol participate in the SEM token  distribution from the block in proportion to their respective SEM token holdings.

Reputation Salary Calculation Example

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | Anchor |  | Proportional Anchor tokens |  | SEM Payout |
| Alice | 404 | 1020 Total / 404 Anchor = | 2.524752475 | 20 Total SEM / Proportional Anchor = | 7.92156863 |
| Bob | 111 | 1020 Total / 111 Anchor = | 9.189189189 | 20 Total SEM / Proportional Anchor = | 2.17647059 |
| Carlo | 303 | 1020 Total / 303 Anchor = | 3.366336634 | 20 Total SEM / Proportional Anchor = | 5.94117647 |
| Donna | 202 | 1020 Total / 202 Anchor = | 5.04950495 | 20 Total SEM / Proportional Anchor = | 3.96078431 |

How does Joe earn tradeable currency on the  Platform?  


SEM tokens \(traded on binance\) are the tradable currency used for and within transactions \(including as gas\). Anchor tokens are the block propagation reputation tokens available to the block propagation DAO members.  


The Anchor tokens determine who has power in the system for deciding:  

1. who gets to make the blocks,

2. whether the blocks are valid in the validation pool, and

3. what percentage of the SEM token denominated reputation salary the Anchor token holders get\).  


The SEM tokens are the fungible \(perfectly transferrable\) currency of the system that are used in transactions contained in blocks, like bitcoin or ether. SEM is added to fees for each transaction by public users so block producers will add their transactions to the next block. These fees determine how many new Anchor tokens are minted for a block, then the fees are distributed to all Anchor holders in SEM denominated reputational salary.  


New Anchor tokens are created in proportion to the number of SEM denominated transaction fees collected by the system in each block. Therefore,  Anchor tokens are highly inflationary. To maintain his relative power, Bob must continue to participate.  


Each time a block is produced, the SEM Token denominated fees from the transactions in the block are shared with the entire Anchor protocol DAO members as SEM Token denominated reputation salary \(SEM Token is earned for each block in proportion to DAO members’ Anchor token holdings\). If Bob owns 1% of Anchor tokens, he earns 1% of all SEM token fees generated by transactions in the block \(if block 1 has 50 SEM token and block 2 has 100 SEM, Bob always makes 1% of the SEM token fees in proportion to his 1% of total available Anchor tokens\). Block producers do not gain immediate SEM token fees, only more Anchor tokens. If Bob doesn’t participate in block production, e.g. Bob does not participate in the validation pool or does not stake an availability stake to be chosen for block production, he still shares the SEM token denominated reputation salary \(for holding proportion of Anchor tokens as an Anchor DAO member\) from the DAO member validation pool, but he does not share in the additionally minted  Anchor tokens. Thus, Bob’s relative power \(as measured by his Anchor token holdings out of total Anchor tokens in circulation\) and SEM token salary decreases.
